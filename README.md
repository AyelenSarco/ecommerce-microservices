# E-commerce Microservices Backend

This repository contains the backend of an e-commerce application built using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

The project is designed to explore and apply real-world backend concepts such as service discovery, API Gateway, centralized routing, and independent service scalability.

Each microservice is responsible for a specific business domain and communicates through well-defined APIs, following clean architecture and separation of concerns.

## Main features:

- Service Discovery using Eureka Server

- API Gateway for centralized routing and request handling

- Independent Spring Boot microservices

- RESTful APIs

- Relational database integration (MySQL)

- Focus on backend architecture, scalability, and maintainability

This project is intended for learning purposes and portfolio demonstration, simulating a real production-oriented backend system.
